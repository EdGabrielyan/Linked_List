# PHP Linked List Implementation

This repository contains a simple implementation of a **Linked List** data structure using **pure PHP**. It demonstrates how to create and manipulate a singly linked list with basic operations like insertion, deletion, traversal, and search.

## ðŸ§  What is a Linked List?

A Linked List is a linear data structure where each element (node) contains:
- **Data**
- A reference (or link) to the **next node**

Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require contiguous memory allocation and are great for scenarios where dynamic memory allocation is needed.
